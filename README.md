# symphony music player

After a long hiatus, the project is now **restarting** in other repositories in a **GitHub** organization: [https://github.com/symphony-mp](https://github.com/symphony-mp). The project will be open-source, multi-platform and will include both online and offline resources.

Soon this old repository will be **private** or **deleted** so if you are interested, a contributor or want to contribute to the project I suggest you migrate to the new repositories available here: [https://github.com/symphony-mp](https://github.com/symphony-mp).

Sincerely, Jo√£o Sereia[\<joao.sereia@softyes.com.br\>](mailto:joao.sereia@softyes.com.br).
